# Parsing

I want to learn to parse markup languages, there are alot of resources on crafting programming language parsers, but not so much for their often ambiguous cousin.

I will take take notes here and document my learnings. I already have some experience but will start from the beginning because I feel like and this way my notes may be useful for you.

More specifically I want to parse HTML and CommonMark, both do describe an implementation in their specs but I want to mix-n-match both (nested Markdown, inline HTML) and extend them. Also design and implement less spec'ed languages.

## Here we go!

1. [BNF and EBNF: What are they and how do they work?](https://www.garshol.priv.no/download/text/bnf.html): [[#Formal grammar]], [[#Compiler compilers]]

## Compiler compilers

Programs, one being YACC (producing C) that automatically write or a full compiler or just the parser from formal grammar.

## Formal grammar

BNF and EBFN.
